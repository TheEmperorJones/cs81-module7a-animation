# Reflection on *loadingAnimation.html*

- What part of the code was most confusing and why?
	- The dual if loops working in combination were interesting and nearly the most confusing element.  Ultimately, it was the fact that the runLoadingAnimation object reacts to elements supplied in the <div> ID in the HTML section.  It's impressive that they talk, and it's impressive that a dedicated CSS document is not necessary to achieve a very simple yet satisfying animation.


- How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
	- It's ultimately a state change that occurs in at a pace that is rapid but noticeably so, and the array's elements are called in a very understandable way to anybody that recognizes the rudiments of cinema.  If it were just test strings appearing it would be less satisfying, as would mere hourglass emojis alternating.  The sequence has a clear beginning and ending, well before the green checkmark appears.



- What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have
	- I made a minor adjustment by changing a font-size, and adding a border.  It had no real effect, except to make the overall appearance slightly less pleasant if anything, less clean.  There was a simplicity to the original which I altered at my peril.
